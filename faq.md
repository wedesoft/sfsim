### What features will the full game have?

Planned features are vertical launch, space station docking, moon landing, atmospheric reentry, and landing on a runway.
The space craft will need flight instruments to support this.

### What operating systems are supported?

Currently GNU/Linux and Microsoft Windows are supported.
Steam Deck has not been tested, but the graphics are likely to be too demanding for it.

### Is the game free software?

Yes, the game is free and open source software ([EPL 1.0][3]).
The source code is [available on Github][2].
It makes use of [Clojure][4], [LWJGL][6], and [Fastmath][5].
The celestical positions are implemented according to [Skyfield][8].
Note that building the project assets takes several days on a modern computer.

### Who made the music?

The free music is made by [Andrewkn][7]!

### When will the game be released?

I hope to release a demo in 2025, but for the full game there is no fixed release date and there is still a lot of work left to do.
You can [wishlist it on Steam][1] to get notified of the release.

### Will there be support for virtual reality headsets?

At the moment, VR support is not planned.
