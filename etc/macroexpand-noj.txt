Sfsim is a space flight simulator under development using Clojure and LWJGL among other libraries.
The Lightweight Java Game Library (LWJGL) contains various bindings including OpenGL and it was used to implement Minecraft Java Edition.
Clojure can utilize Java libraries and it facilitates compile time resolution of names which results in efficient byte code.
OpenGL allows to offload the 3D rendering work to the GPU.
While Vulkan is supposed to supersede OpenGL, learning OpenGL is less difficult and can be used as a stepping stone for learning Vulkan.
This talk shows how Clojure can be used to do test driven development of OpenGL shaders, which facilitates developing and refactoring of more complex shader programs.

* Midje OpenGL tests
* recording integration test images
* templating (e.g. fractal brownian motion)

# Talk title: Computer Graphics with Clojure, LWJGL, and Fastmath
# Abstract
sfsim is a space flight simulator under development.
It makes use of Clojure, LWJGL, and Fastmath among other libraries.
More than half of the code deals with graphics.
This talk gives a short introduction using LWJGL's OpenGL bindings to get started with rendering data from NASA's CGI Moon Kit.

# Bio
Jan studied compiler construction and robotics and later did a PhD in computer vision.
He currently works in industry developing inspection software.
His first programming languages were Omikron Basic and later Borland Pascal.
In industry he used C++, Ruby, and Python.
In his spare time he got interested in Ruby, GNU Guile, and finally Clojure.
