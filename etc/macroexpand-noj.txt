Sfsim is a space flight simulator under development using Clojure and LWJGL among other libraries.
The Lightweight Java Game Library (LWJGL) contains various bindings including OpenGL and it was used to implement Minecraft Java Edition.
Clojure can utilize Java libraries and it facilitates compile time resolution of names which results in efficient byte code.
OpenGL allows to offload the 3D rendering work to the GPU.
While Vulkan is supposed to supersede OpenGL, learning OpenGL is less difficult and can be used as a stepping stone for learning Vulkan.
This talk shows how Clojure can be used to do test driven development of OpenGL shaders, which facilitates developing and refactoring of more complex shader programs.

* Midje OpenGL tests
