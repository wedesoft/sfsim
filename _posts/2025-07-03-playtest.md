Hi everybody!

I have just pushed a playtest build to Steam and the button to join the sfsim playtest is [visible on the sfsim page][1] now.
Before you join, please be aware that sfsim is still very much a work in progress and a lot of things are still missing!
Also check the estimated graphics requirements on the [sfsim page][1] in case you want to run the game fullscreen.

At the moment you can take off and fly around in the atmosphere and the aerodynamics should be fairly realistic.

Here are the important key bindings for testing:
* Esc: toggle the menu
* Alt-Return: toggle fullscreen
* P: pause/unpause
* G: gear down/up
* B: wheel brakes
* Shift-B: parking brake
* /: air brake
* A, S, D, W: flight stick
* Q, E: rudder
* R, F: thrust
* numerical keypad: change camera position
* "," and ".": increase/decrease camera distance

Note that you need to operate the rudder and flight stick in combination to prevent large side slip angles which cause the delta wing to roll.

Let me know if there are any problems.
I tested it on Windows 11 and Debian 12, but I hope it will run on other versions of Windows and GNU/Linux as well.

If you have time, please head over to the [sfsim playtest discussion][2] and let me now your thoughts.
Here are a few questions from my side:
* what graphics card do you have?
* what is the resolution of your screen?
* what is the framerate of the game in fullscreen mode?
* what do you think about the graphics quality?
* did you enjoy the aerodynamics?
* what do you miss in the space sim genre?
* are the keyboard mappings ok or would you prefer them different?
* do you have any questions not answered in the [FAQ][3]?
