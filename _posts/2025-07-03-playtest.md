Hi everybody!

I have just pushed a playtest build to Steam and the button to join the sfsim playtest is [visible on the sfsim page][1] now.
Before you join, please be aware that sfsim is still very much a work in progress.

At the moment you can take off and fly around in the atmosphere and the aerodynamics should be fairly realistic.

Here are the important key bindings for testing:
* Esc: toggle the menu
* F: toggle fullscreen
* P: pause/unpause
* G: gear down/up
* B: wheel brakes
* A, S, D, W: flight stick
* Q, E: rudder
* Space: thrust (keep pressed for continuous thrust)
* numerical keypad: change camera position
* "," and ".": increase/decrease camera distance

Let me know if there are any problems.
I tested it on Windows 11 and Debian 12, but I hope it will run on other versions of Windows and GNU/Linux as well.
