Hi,

I finally got the first version of the joystick configuration dialog working.
One can configure axes and buttons in the dialog.
There also is a common dead-zone setting for all joystick axes.
The configuration can be saved using the save button.
The config gets saved in the `~/.config/sfsim` directory under GNU/Linux.
Under windows the configuration directory is `%APPDATA%/sfsim`.

See [keyboard shortcut page](/sfsim/keyboard/) for up-to-date keyboard bindings.

Enjoy!
