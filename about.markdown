sfsim (space flight simulator) is an upcoming space simulator with realistic physics and a true-to-scale Earth-Moon system.
Take off, dock with a space station, land on the moon, perform atmospheric reentry, and finish with a touchdown.

Key Features:
*  Realistic Physics: Simulate spaceflight with accurate orbital mechanics and aerodynamics.
* Real-Scale Earth-Moon System: Navigate a true-to-scale environment based on NASA celestial dynamics data that demands real-world planning and precision.
* Complete Mission Phases: Take control from liftoff to landing, including:
  * Atmospheric launch
  * Orbital rendezvous and docking
  * Trans-lunar injection and lunar landings
  * Reentry through Earth's atmosphere
  * Final descent and safe touchdown
* Manual and Assisted Controls: Fly by hand or with the help of flight assistance tools â€” perfect for both veterans and newcomers.
