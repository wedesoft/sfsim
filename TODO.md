# TODO

* compute path to neighbours at different levels for different faces
* switch unit tests to Midje
* adapt outer tesselation resolution to neighbouring tiles
* redesign floating point math of height maps
* implement and test dropping and loading of tiles
* adapt z-range depending on distance to globe
* method to process paths from quad tree (e.g. load/unload OpenGL objects)
* Get scale-image to work on large images
* Skydome: counter-clockwise front face (GL11/glFrontFace GL11/GL\_CCW) (configuration object)
* Skydome scaled to ZFAR * 0.5
* always add child nodes or remove child nodes?
