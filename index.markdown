*sfsim* is an upcoming realistic space flight simulator where you take control of every mission phase.
Planned features are liftoff, orbital docking, lunar landings, atmospheric reentry, and final touchdown.
The plan is to include a true-to-scale Earth-Moon system.

See [github.com/wedesoft/sfsim][1] for source code and build instructions.
