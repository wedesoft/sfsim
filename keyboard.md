It is planned to add a keyboard mapping help page to the user interface.
For the time being I will try to keep this page up to date:

* Esc: toggle the menu
* Alt-Return: toggle fullscreen
* P: pause/unpause
* G: gear down/up
* B: wheel brakes
* Shift-B: parking brake
* /: air brake
* A, D: ailerons or RCS roll
* numerical keypad 5: center ailerons
* S, W: elevator or RCS pitch
* Q, E: rudder or RCS yaw
* Ctrl+Q: center rudder
* R, F: thrust
* \\: toggle between aerofoil and RCS thrusters
* numerical keypad 4, 6, 8, 2, 1, 3: change camera position
* "," and ".": increase/decrease camera distance

If you have a joystick and/or thrust lever, you can set those up in the menu.
